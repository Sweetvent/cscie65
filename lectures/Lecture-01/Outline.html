CSCI S-65: Advanced Mobile Application Development Using Swift and iOS Summer 2016 Harvard Summer School Instructor: Daniel Bromberg – bromberg@fas.harvard.edu
Lecture 1 Outline Issued: 06/20/2016
Introduction: Learn how to make Apps on the iPhone (and iPad)
(%’s are proportions of time spent within the course)
• Swift: Apple’s new language, replacing Objective-C (25%)  
• Foundation: Libraries common with all environments: watchOS, tvOS, iOS,  MacOS (10%)  
• Xcode: Development and deployment environment, especially Storyboard but  also debugger & inspectors (25%)  
• Cocoa Touch: Libraries specific to iOS, especially UIKit (40%)  Rapidly evolving environment: 6 versions of Swift; many updates to Xcode since launch of language
Logistics  
• Prerequisites
o Experience with a strongly typed language
o Experience with an object oriented language
o 3 college semesters or 1 year professional experience  
• Meeting times and dates  
• Teacher Intro  
• Please read syllabus cover-to-cover  
• The Strict Parts: Attendance, Academic honesty, Assignments  
• Time commitment  
• Grading: 15% class participation; 35% final project; 50% homework   • Final Project
Interdisciplinary class (in no particular order)
iOS is the center – all else will serve the practical application of iOS
• Traditional software engineering: breaking up and re-assembling a problem   • Learning a new language  
• Navigating a complex IDE: 100’s of bells and whistles  
• Release engineering: Apple’s conventions, code signing  
• Event driven programming: handlers, background threads, observers, notifications   • Mobile visual design
Dividing up functionality, creating transitions
Obeying Apple’s UI design conventions  
• Working with a large library of Frameworks  
• Staying connected: working with networks and servers   • Other specifics of a smart handheld  
Strict security: Code signing, App sandboxing Location awareness
Limited power
Limited / highly variable Internet
Complex finger gestures 3-axis accelerometer  
Swift: A modern grab-bag (in no particular order)
Avoid as many pitfalls of C and un-typed languages as possible
• Built-in dynamic storage types: Arrays and Dictionaries
• Type safety
• Explicit conversions required (vs. NULL == 0 == false in C)
• Automatic memory management (Automatic Reference Counting, or ARC)
• Read-only enforcement of constants
• The empty (null / nil) reference problem: Optionals
• Compact, expressive code
o Overloaded operators
o Type inference
o Punctuationelimination 
• Rich standard library  
• Object oriented  
• Functional programming
o Functions as first-class objects
o AnonymousFunctions/Closures 
• Speed & small footprint: fully compiled (some pitfalls remain)  
• Generics  
• Available for not just iOS – Mac OS X, and now Linux!
