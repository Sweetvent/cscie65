      <h1> CSCI S-65: Advanced Mobile Application Development using Swift and iOS</h1>
      <h3>Harvard Extension School Summer 2017</h3>

      <p>The following should be answered without consulting any
	references. You should be able get most correct. You may
	self-grade by looking up information afterwards. If you need
	your test “graded” feel free to e-mail it to:
	bromberg@fas.harvard.edu and I will be happy to take a
	look.</p>

      <ol>
	<li><p>Type inference is a major distinguishing feature of
	  Swift. Give a simple example. Does type inference happen at
	  compile time or run time?</p></li>

	<li><p>Swift doesn’t use pointers in the sense of integers that
	  directly represent offsets in the process’ memory
	  space. Instead it uses “reference” types, but reference
	  types aren’t allowed to refer to “nothing”. Instead a
	  Swift-specific mechanism is used. What is that mechanism?
	  [Advanced: For backward compatibility only, Swift actually
	  does have a pointer wrapper type. What is it?]</p></li>

	<li><p>What are the defining characteristics of
	Object-Oriented Programming?</p></li>

	<li><p>Give one example of a strongly typed language and one
	  example of a weakly typed language.</p></li>

	<li><p>Which is faster in runtime when passing a 1,000 element
	  array from a calling function to a called function: by value
	  or by reference? Why?</p></li>

	<li><p>What is the maximum value that can be stored in an
	eight bit unsigned integer?<p></li>
	
	<li><p>Assume a variable is of type unsigned integer and holds
	  the maximum positive value possible. What happens when 1 is
	  added (using <code>+</code>) to the variable and the result
	  stored back into the variable? [Advanced: there are actually
	  two answers depending on the language; Swift differs from C
	  in this regard. Explain.]</p></li>
	
	<li><p>The following program is intenrded to print the numbers
	    from 0 through 10, inclusive. Fix the bug:</p>
	  <code>for ( x = 0; x &lt; 10; x++ ) { println(x); }</code>
	  <br />
	  <p>Why is this question no longer relevant to Swift 3?
	    [Advanced: there is a way to “implement this bug” in Swift
	    3. How?]</p></li>

	<li><p>The following should be answered in terms of proportion
	    to the number of elements stored in the specified data
	    structure, in big-O notation:</p>

	  <ul>
	    <li><p>How long does it take to find an element in a Hash table, given its key?</p></li>
	    <li><p>How long does it take to find an element in a Hash table, given its value?</p></li>
	    <li><p>How long does it take to find an element in an unsorted Array, given its value?</p></li>
	    <li><p>How long does it take to find an element in an unsorted Array, given its index?</p></li>
	    <li><p>How long does it take to find an element in a sorted Array, given its value?</p></li>
	  </ul>
	</li>

	<li>
	  <p>Implement the Fibonacci function in your favorite language:<br />
	    &ndash; Recursively, using the natural approach given the definition:<br />
	    <code>f(n) = f(n -1) + f(n – 2)</code> for all n &gt;= 0<br />
	    &ndash; Iteratively, using a loop and no recursive function call.</p>
	</li>
	
	<li>
	  <p>Name 3 real-world constraints that make App development
	    for any mobile device more challenging than for a
	    desktop. This should be based on your own observations, not
	    iOS particulars. There is no right set of answers, rather an
	    appeal to your experience as an advanced user, and using
	    your common sense. It should not involve getting “deep in
	    the weeds” regarding programming or iOS.</p>
	</li>
	
	<li>
	  <p>Name 3 advantages that make App development for an
	    iPhone or iPad richer and more interesting than for a
	    desktop. Again, base your answer on your existing
	    observation &amp; experience.</p>
	</li>
	
	<li>
	  <p>Name at least one graphical IDE you’ve used in the past
	    and discuss an advantage of using it versus using a plain
	    text editor to develop software, and a disadvantage or
	    annoyance.</p>
	</li>
	  
	<li>
	  <p>What’s your favorite no frills code editor outside of any IDE?</p>
	</li>
