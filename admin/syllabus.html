      <section>  
	<p><strong>Objective</strong>To lay a foundation in the concepts, libraries, and
	  development tools necessary to create and deploy a realistic "App" (mobile
	  software application) on latest-generation iPhones and iPads. We will focus on the
	  fundamentals: the rapidly maturing Swift programming language; the Xcode IDE
	  (Integrated Development Environment); the iOS development cycle especially the
	  Xcode interactive debugger; the essential Foundation and Cocoa Touch libraries;
	  Apple best practices, especially the Model-View-Controller paradigm; responsive
	  event handling, such as thread-aware task dispatching; the storage and recall of
	  user data to remote & local databases; and deploying apps via iTunes Connect.
	</p>
	<p>
	  While the iOS API and Xcode toolset is vast, we intend to show enough core
	  material and patterns such that students graduate able to apply their knowledge to
	  uncharted territory and rapidly absorb advanced material on their own.
	</p>
      </section>

      <section>
	<p><strong>Pre-qualifications</strong>Students must
	  take <a href="/cscie65/admin/PreQualTestSpring2017.pdf">self-assessment test</a>
	  before enrolling. The test should take less than an hour. Answers will be available in
	  a sub-directory. It is important before enrolling and investing considerable
	  time &amp; expense in the course that you feel confident in your answers. Please
	  e-mail me individually if you are unsure about any particular answer or the
	  overall difficulty level.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	  <strong>READINGS</strong>Readings will come from a combination of: The Apple
	  Developer Library; Chapters from new e-Books; and online tutorials. Students must
	  understand that due to the young age of the technology, written documentation is
	  relatively scarce and academic-grade texts do not yet exist. It is essential to be
	  comfortable assembling know-how through a variety of sources, which will vary
	  considerably in style, abstraction level, and intellectual depth.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	  The following introductory material is highly recommended as preparation for the
	  first class and will be due for the 2nd class. Note all videos must be viewed in
	  Safari on MacOS or iOS, the WWDC iOS App, or through iTunes Podcasts.
	</p>

	<ul>
	  <li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift/">One-page promotional background</a></li>
	  <li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2014/#402">Official intro video at WWDC 2014</a></li>

	  <li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/GuidedTour.html">Technical introduction to Swift</a></li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>
	  <strong>EQUIPMENT</strong>Students must bring their own portable Mac running OSX
	  10.12, with at least 4GB of RAM, an iOS device running iOS 10 with the latest
	  updates, and Xcode 8 with the latest updates. For those interested in specializing
	  their work for the iPad, owning one is highly recommended as well. In order to
	  install apps on their own devices and distribute their compiled Apps to their peers
	  and staff, students <em>do not</em> need be a member of any Apple program. Instead,
	  any device physically connected to your development machine can accept installation
	  of any App you write. The catch is that developer Apps will be valid for just two
	  weeks from the point of installation. As soon as you re-install, however, the two
	  week deadline is renewed.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	  <strong>CLASS ASSIGNMENTS</strong>(which include readings) and lecture teaching
	  materials (mostly example code, some diagrams) will be hosted at a private Git
	  server:<br>
          <a href="/cscie65/assignments">http://git.classyswift.com/e65.git/assignments</a> (TO BE CHANGED LIKELY TO GITHUB soon)<br />
	  <a href="/cscie65/lectures">http://git.classyswift.com/e65.git/lectures</a><br />
	  Each student will also have an individual repository, with a username and
	  password, into which they will submit all assigned work. The naming conventions
	  will be spelled out so that all submissions have the same directory structure.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	  <strong>ONLINE DISCUSSION</strong>We will have a moderated discussion forum in
	  Canvas, with one thread per assignment. This is an essential tool to disseminate
	  information efficiently in a fast-paced environment.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	  <em>All questions about the course material should be directed to this forum for
	    maximum visibility to staff and students.</em> Students are strongly encouraged to
	  use the forum on a daily basis to make their homework time efficient. Show
	  leadership by asking questions. If you have a question that conerns the
	  fundamentals, so does at least a third of the class. As far as the staff is
	  concerned, a central premise of learning programming is doing some research,
	  trying a few solutions, getting stuck, and asking an informed question – no matter
	  how &lsquo;basic&rsquo; you think it is. Participation credit is generously
	  awarded for such efforts.
	</p>

	<p>
	  <strong>OTHER CONTACT</strong>E-mail, calls, and texts to the staff should only be
	  used if you feel you need privacy, and in that order.
	</p>

	<p>
	  <strong>IDE</strong>XCode
	  8.2 <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/ide/">https://developer.apple.com/xcode/ide/</a>
	</p>
	
	<p>
	  <strong>ONLINE READ-EVALUATE-PRINT-LOOP (REPL)</strong>
	  <a href="https://swiftlang.ng.bluemix.net/#/repl">https://swiftlang.ng.bluemix.net</a>
	  This is a pure Swift simulator - that is, nothing iOS specific - in a simulated
	  terminal. It is good for entering experimental snippets to help learn the core
	  language, such as closures and looping syntax. This is not an official Apple site;
	  however it is quite nice.
	</p>

	<p>
	  <strong>WORKLOAD</strong>This is an intensive course with ambitious goals of
	  teaching a new programming language, an IDE, several frameworks, a variety of UI and
	  design concepts, and practical debugging and deployment knowledge. Assignments will
	  be issued once per week and due the next week. Students must commit to roughly 15
	  hours per week of homework, 3 hours per week of in-person class/section, and 30-60
	  minutes of pre-recorded lectures that cover pre-requisites for actual class.
	</p>

	<section>
	  <p>
	    <strong>ASSIGNMENTS</strong>Timely completion of reading and assignments is
	    absolutely essential. There will not be much time for the staff to help students
	    catch up on missed work or missed classes. Late work will not be accepted except for
	    medical emergency or religious observance (for the latter, prior notification
	    required). Because some answers may be revealed. in subsequent lectures, work that’s
	    even a little bit late will not be accepted. Rather we will be very inclined towards
	    partial credit as long as you turn in what you have on time, even if it doesn’t work
	    or won’t compile. If you are having technical difficulties in submission, let us
	    know immediately at the start of class and a TF will help you.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    In the event of any conflicting or ambiguous information on exactly what’s
	    expected from each assignment, whether logistics or content, please let us know
	    immediately. The Head TF is the final authority for all homework related matters.
	  </p>

	    <strong>Grading</strong>25% Class participation (includes section); 50% general
	    assignments; 25% final project.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    <strong>Attendance</strong>Because all lectures are now archived in this edition
	    of the course with viewer tracking, all lectures must be attended in person or
	    show as viewed to receive a grade.

	    <strong>Academic honesty &amp; integrity</strong>You are bound
	    by <a href="https://www.extension.harvard.edu/resources-policies/student-conduct/academic-integrity">these
	      policies</a> for the entire course:<br />
	    
	    https://www.extension.harvard.edu/resources-policies/student-conduct/academic-integrity<br />
	    
	    There is no flexibility in these rules because they apply to the entire Harvard
	    Extension School.</p>

	  <p>In addition, defining plagiarism in computer code has unique challenges, partly
	    due to the fact that some simple techniques, especially those mandated by the
	    given API or OS, are virtually identical across all programs, whereas deeper
	    designs and algorithms vary as widely as original poems by different
	    authors. When you learn how to do something from code on the Internet,
	    no matter how well the learning process worked, and no matter how short the
	    example,<br />

	    <strong style="text-align: center;">you must cite the source - SINGLE LINE SOURCES INCLUDED.</strong><br />

	    The citation should appear as a comment (usually a valid URL, or complete book
	    title and page) right above the relevant code. The only exception is if we've
	    already given the source to the entire class. In particular, any snippets in the
	    Apple Technical documentation need not be cited.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>The citation process is not merely busy-work; it helps us learn what students
	    need help with, and to see if they're using good, up-to-date learning tools.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    There is never a penalty for citing any (or many) sources; in fact it will reflect
	    positively in your participation in the course. Before doing online search for
	    pre-cooked solutions, however, apply some pedagogical sense:<br />
	    
            <strong style="text-align: center;">For the first assignment, many answers are
	      just one or two lines. Think about how best to learn. Learning a language requires
	      writing code from scratch - using the fundamentals. It doesn't matter if there are
	      dozens of existing solutions that are just a few search keywords away. Use
	      official Apple documentation, Apple tutorials, and the help of the staff only.</strong><br />
